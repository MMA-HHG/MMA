    "# The usage of full-saddle-point dipoles\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows a simplified way to infer the microscopic response with a simplified model based on the Full Saddle Point Approximation (FSPA), which estimates the dipole response based on semi-classical electron's trajectories. THe only input parameter of these simplified calculations is the local intensity of the driving field. As a result, the microscopic response is obtained as a simple mask of the intensity and phase profiles of the driving pulse. The final result of the notebook is a ***coherence map***, which provides an estimate of the macroscopic volume where all the microscopic emitters contribute constructively.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The outline of the calculation, followed in this notebook, is:\n",
    "1) We load the data of the IR propagation.\n",
    "2) We obtain the complexified form of the driving field, which gives the phase and intensity profile of the driving pulse.\n",
    "3) We use an external code to compute the FSPA-dipoles for a slected harmonic order in the required intensity range.\n",
    "4) We create the coherence map. "

    "We choose the time-and-space window to see the pulse as it propagates through the medium. Note that we measure the intensity by the \"expected harmonic cutoff\", these units are obtained by the formula $E_{\\text{cut-off}} = I_P + 3.17U_p$ (it is directly proportional since $U_p$ is linearly proportional to the intensity). Then we plot the plasma channel create by the passage of the pulse. We show both absolute density of free electrons and also relative to the local density.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are more technical details about the data: We plot the pulse directly as it is stored in the file. This means that we a co-moving frame defined by the group velocity, $v_g$, of the pulse: this is the computational window of CUPRAD. The group velocity $v_g$ is defined from the linear dispersion relation and depends on the chosen reference pressure and central wavelength. Possible density modulation is relative to this reference pressure, whcih is the reason we use the average pressure in our examples. Physically speaking, $v_g$ is arbitrary and needs to be considered in further processing. For example, the Pyrhonic class represented by `CUPRAD_res` contains methods to adjust to the reference given by the speed of light (both activelly by changing the data or just by sychronising the clocks in the $t$-grid)."
