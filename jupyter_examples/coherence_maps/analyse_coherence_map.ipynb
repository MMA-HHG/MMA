    "# Cohrenece maps using of full-saddle-point dipoles\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows a simplified way to infer the microscopic response with a simplified model based on the Full Saddle Point Approximation (FSPA), which estimates the dipole response based on semi-classical electron's trajectories. The only input parameter of these simplified calculations is the local intensity of the driving field. As a result, the microscopic response is obtained as a simple mask of the intensity and phase profiles of the driving pulse. The final result of the notebook is a ***coherence map***, which provides an estimate of the macroscopic volume where all the microscopic emitters contribute constructively.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The outline of the calculation, followed in this notebook, is:\n",
    "1) We load the data of the IR propagation.\n",
    "2) We obtain the complexified form of the driving field, which gives the phase and intensity profile of the driving pulse.\n",
    "3) We use an external code to compute the FSPA-dipoles for a slected harmonic order in the required intensity range.\n",
    "4) We create the coherence map by masking the harmonic response onto the complexified field."
